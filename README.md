# Dynamic FPGA Reconfiguration Using Natural Language Prompts  

This repository explores the feasibility of developing a dynamic FPGA reconfiguration system powered by natural language prompts. The goal is to enable users to type simple commands, such as "Create an 8-bit adder," and automatically reconfigure an FPGA to implement the desired functionality.  

## üöÄ Features  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Leverages NLP frameworks to interpret user commands.  
- **Dynamic Hardware Generation**: Utilizes open-source FPGA design tools for on-the-fly reconfiguration.  
- **Versatile Applications**: Supports rapid prototyping, educational tools, and AI-driven hardware optimization.  

## üõ†Ô∏è System Overview  
The system integrates the following components:  
- **Open-Source FPGA Tools**: Tools for hardware synthesis and implementation.  
- **NLP Frameworks**: To convert natural language prompts into hardware specifications.  
- **Dynamic Hardware Generation**: Methodologies for real-time hardware configuration.  

## üåü Potential Applications  
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly generate hardware designs based on high-level descriptions.  
- **Education**: Simplify teaching and learning of FPGA concepts.  
- **AI-Driven Optimization**: Automate and enhance hardware designs using AI and machine learning.  

## üìÇ Repository Structure  
- **`src/`**: Source code for NLP and FPGA integration.  
- **`docs/`**: Documentation for the system's architecture and methodology.
