# FPGA-reconfiguration-using-NLP
This project explores the feasibility of developing a dynamic FPGA reconfiguration system powered by natural language prompts. The goal is to enable users to type simple commands, such as "Create an 8-bit adder," and automatically reconfigure an FPGA to implement the desired functionality.
